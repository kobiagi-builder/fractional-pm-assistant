# Fractional PM Assistant

An AI agent that helps fractional Product Managers manage multiple customers, maintain obsessive documentation, and orchestrate specialized capabilities for PM work.

## What It Does

The Fractional PM Assistant acts as your always-on PM partner that:

1. **Maintains Customer Context** - Keeps comprehensive, always-current documentation for each customer (company info, financials, event logs, artifacts)
2. **Enforces Documentation Discipline** - Automatically updates customer files after every interaction
3. **Orchestrates Expert Work** - Delegates specialized tasks to focused sub-agents (research, analysis, design)
4. **Self-Evolves** - Builds new capabilities as your needs grow

## Architecture: Skills vs Capabilities

We use a **hybrid architecture** that separates concerns by complexity and autonomy:

### Why the Separation?

| Aspect | Skills | Capabilities |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Execution** | Inline, same conversation | Autonomous sub-agent |
| **Duration** | Quick (<1 min) | Extended (1+ min) |
| **Focus** | Internal operations | Expert domain work |
| **Context** | Shares main context | Isolated, focused context |
| **Use Case** | Doc updates, loading context | Research, analysis, design |

**Skills** are for things that should happen quickly and stay in the flow of conversation - like updating a customer file or loading context.

**Capabilities** are for deep work that benefits from isolation and focus - like conducting competitive research or designing user flows. They run as sub-agents with their own context.

## Current Capabilities

### Skills (Internal Operations)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **build-agent** | Meta-skill to add new rules, skills, or capabilities. Always asks for guidelines before creating. |
| **load-customer-context** | Reads all customer files and provides context summary |
| **update-customer-docs** | Systematically updates customer files after interactions |

### Capabilities (Expert Sub-Agents)

| Capability | Expertise |
|------------|-----------|
| **user-interviews-analyst** | Interview design, facilitation, thematic analysis, persona building |
| **data-analyst** | Product analytics, metrics, A/B testing, dashboards |
| **competition-researcher** | Competitive intelligence, market analysis, battle cards |
| **prioritization-analyst** | RICE framework, opportunity scoring, roadmap planning |
| **flow-designer** | User flows, journey maps, service blueprints |
| **ux-ui-designer** | Wireframes, interaction specs, design systems |

## Rules (Always Active)

1. **Customer Context Loading** - MUST load customer folder before any customer-specific work
2. **Obsessive Documentation** - MUST update customer files after every interaction

## The Build-Agent Skill

The `build-agent` skill is the meta-skill that allows the agent to evolve. When you need a new capability:

1. Describe what you need
2. The skill determines if it should be a **Rule**, **Skill**, or **Capability**
3. It **always asks you for guidelines** before creating anything
4. Creates the new component with your specifications

**Decision Framework:**

```
Does it need to happen automatically, without user invocation?
├── YES → RULE
└── NO → Is it lightweight and quick (<1 min)?
    ├── YES → SKILL
    └── NO → CAPABILITY
```

## Usage

### Starting Work with a Customer

```
User: "Let's work on SolarDefend"
Agent: [Loads customer context]
       "I've loaded SolarDefend's context. [Summary]. What would you like to focus on?"
```

### After Any Customer Interaction

```
Agent: [Automatically updates docs]
       "Updated SolarDefend's documentation:
        - customer-info.md: Added pilot progress
        - event-log.md: Logged today's call"
```

### Requesting Expert Work

```
User: "I need competitive analysis for SolarDefend"
Agent: [Invokes competition-researcher capability]
       [Sub-agent performs deep research]
       [Saves to artifacts/]
       "Completed competitive analysis. Saved to artifacts/research-competitors-2025-01.md"
```

### Adding New Capabilities

```
User: "I need the agent to help with pricing strategy"
Agent: [Invokes build-agent skill]
       "This should be a CAPABILITY because it requires strategic analysis.
        Before I create it, I need some guidelines:
        1. What pricing frameworks should it use?
        2. Should it factor in competitive pricing?
        ..."
```

## Philosophy

1. **Documentation is a superpower** - The agent is obsessive about keeping records current
2. **Context is king** - Always load full context before customer work
3. **Right tool for the job** - Skills for quick ops, Capabilities for deep work
4. **Evolve with use** - Build new capabilities as needs emerge
5. **Guidelines matter** - Always ask before creating new components
